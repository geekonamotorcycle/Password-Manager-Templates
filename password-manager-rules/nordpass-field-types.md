# NordPass Field Type Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the field types supported by NordPass when creating custom templates. Understanding these field types ensures that structured credentials are properly stored and formatted in the NordPass vault.

## Supported Field Types in NordPass

### 1. **Text**

- A free-form text field.
- Used for general descriptions, usernames, or metadata.

### 2. **Password**

- A concealed password field.
- Used for storing login credentials, API tokens, and security keys.

### 3. **Date**

- A structured date field.
- Used for tracking **creation dates, expiration dates, or review timelines**.

### 4. **Email**

- A dedicated field for storing email addresses.
- Helps with autofill and categorization.

### 5. **Phone**

- Stores phone numbers in a structured format.
- Useful for storing contact details related to credentials.

## Best Practices for Using Field Types

1. **Use Password Fields for Sensitive Information** – Store credentials, API keys, and security tokens in **Password** fields instead of plain text.

2. **Track Expirations Using Date Fields** – Store renewal, expiration, or review dates in the **Date** field to maintain lifecycle visibility.

3. **Utilize Email Fields for Authentication** – Store login-related email addresses in the **Email** field instead of a generic text field.

4. **Leverage Phone Fields for Contact Information** – Store support or account recovery phone numbers in the **Phone** field.
