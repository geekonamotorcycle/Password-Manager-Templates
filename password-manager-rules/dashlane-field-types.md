# Dashlane Field Type Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the field types supported by Dashlane when creating custom templates. Understanding these field types ensures that structured credentials are properly stored and formatted in the Dashlane vault.

## Supported Field Types in Dashlane

### 1. **Text**

- A free-form text field.
- Used for storing general descriptions, usernames, or additional metadata.

### 2. **Email**

- A structured field for storing email addresses.
- Helps with autofill and categorization of login credentials.

### 3. **Phone**

- Stores phone numbers in a structured format.
- Useful for storing contact details related to credentials.

### 4. **URL**

- A dedicated field for storing web addresses.
- Used for linking credentials to websites or online services.

### 5. **Date**

- A structured date field.
- Used for tracking **creation dates, expiration dates, or access review timelines**.

## Best Practices for Using Field Types

1. **Use Email Fields for Authentication Data** – When storing login information associated with an email, use the **Email** field instead of a text field.
2. **Leverage URL Fields for Quick Access** – Always store login-related web addresses in the **URL** field for easy navigation.
3. **Use Date Fields for Expiration Tracking** – Store renewal and expiration dates using the **Date** field to monitor credential lifecycles.
4. **Utilize Phone Fields for Contact Details** – If an account has support or emergency contacts, store them in a **Phone** field instead of a generic text field.
